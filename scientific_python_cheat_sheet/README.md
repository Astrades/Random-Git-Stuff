# Scientific Python Cheat Sheet

## Overview
This is an overview of python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib functions that are
useful for scientific work. It tries to keep examples as compact as possible.

Chose one of the following layouts:
* [website](https://ipgp.github.io/scientific_python_cheat_sheet)
* [markdown](sheet.md)

Or the print version (without pandas until there are enough commands for a
third page)

* [high contrast pdf (2016-06-16)](https://github.com/IPGP/scientific_python_cheat_sheet/raw/master/print_version/high_contrast.pdf)
* [low contrast pdf (2016-06-16)](https://github.com/IPGP/scientific_python_cheat_sheet/raw/master/print_version/low_contrast.pdf)

## Printing
Printing the last version is a bit complicated so far if you want to have the
same layout as on the webpage but possible: You can save the CSS layout as an
image in firefox: 

1. use `shift + f2` to open the web console. 
2. Arange the page as you want to print it. We found that two columns is
   suitable for printing on A3 pages. You can either resize your browser or use
   the built-in zoom function for this (e.g. ctrl + mousewheel on firefox).
3. The command `screenshot out.png --fullpage` saves the current complete view
   of the page to the download folder.
4. Print the long image on several papers or cut it in pieces with the image
   software of your choice (e.g. gimp or inkscape). 

Hopefully this will be simpler in the future !

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, you only need to edit the file [sheet.md](sheet.md)
and push it to the master branch (preferably via pull-request). The website
updates automatically. 

If, beyond your knowledge of Python, you also master HTML and CSS, you can also
contribute to the design of the website. You can submit your ideas via the
issues section or directly via pull-request.
